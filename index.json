While some galaxies are already spectroscopically confirmed, there is mounting evidence that a subsample of the candidates with particularly red inferred UV colors are in fact lower redshift contaminants.These interlopers are often found to be HST-dark or optically-fain galaxies at z~2-6, a population key to understanding dust-obscured star formation throughout cosmic time. This paper demonstrates the complementarity of ground-based mm-interferometry and JWST infrared imaging to unveil the true nature of red 1.5-2.0 um dropouts that have been selected as ultra-high-redshift galaxy candidates. We present NOEMA Polyfix follow-up observations of four JWST red 1.5-2.0 um dropouts selected by Yan et al. 2023 as ultra-high-redshift candidates in the PEARLS field. The new NOEMA observations constrain the rest-frame far-infrared continuum emission and efficiently discriminate between intermediate- and high-redshift solutions. We report \u003e10sigma NOEMA continuum detections of all our target galaxies at observed frequencies of 236 and 252 GHz, with FIR slopes indicating a redshift z\u003c5. We model their optical-to-FIR spectral energy distribution (SED) with multiple SED codes, and find that they are not z\u003e10 galaxies but instead dust-obscured, massive star-forming galaxies at z~2-4. The contribution to the cosmic star-formation rate density of such sources is not negligible at z~3.5 (phi \u003e 1.9-4.4 x10^-3 cMpc^-3), in line with previous studies of optically-faint/sub-millimeter galaxies. This work showcases a new way to select intermediate- to high-redshift dust-obscured galaxies in JWST fields with minimal wavelength coverage to open a new window on obscured star-formation at intermediate redshifts ","tags":["High-z galaxies"],"title":"NOEMA reveals the true nature of luminous red JWST z\u003e10 galaxy candidates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.A.

The dust and [C II] emission are enclosed within a ~500 pc radius, with the central beam (r \u003c 144 pc) accounting for ~25% (8%) of the total continuum ([C II]) emission. The far-infrared (FIR) luminosity density increases radially from ~5 × 10^11 Lsun kpc^-2 to a central value of ~70 × 10^11 Lsun kpc^-2 (SFRD ~50-700 Msun/yr kpc^-2). The [C II] kinematics are dispersion dominated with a constant velocity dispersion of 137+-6 km s^1. The constant dispersion implies that the underlying mass distribution is not centrally peaked, consistent with the expectations of a flat gas mass profile. The lack of an upturn in velocity dispersion within the central beam is inconsistent with a black hole mass greater than M BH \u003c 6.5 × 10^8 Msun (2sigma level), unless highly fine-tuned changes in the interstellar medium properties conspire to produce a decrease of the gas mass in the central beam comparable to the black hole mass. Our observations therefore imply either that (a) the black hole is less massive than previously measured, or (b) the central peak of the FIR and [C II] emission are not tracing the location of the black hole, as suggested by the tentative offset between the near-infrared position of the quasar and the ALMA continuum emission.","tags":["Quasars"],"title":"ALMA 300 pc Resolution Imaging of a z = 6.79 Quasar: No Evidence for Supermassive Black Hole Influence on the C II Kinematics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.A.

Recent SCUBA2 imaging revealed the presence of 17 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) with sky separations 0.'7 \u003c θ \u003c 2.'4 from these three quasars.

While most of the SCUBA2-selected sources are detected with ALMA in the continuum, no [C II]158 μm line emission could be detected, indicating that they are not at the quasar redshifts. Based on the serendipitous detection of CO 7-6 and [C I]809 μm emission lines, we find that four SMGs in the field of PJ231-20 are at z ~ 2.4, which is coincident with the redshift of an Mg II absorber in the quasar rest-frame UV spectrum. We report the discovery of two LAEs within \u003c0.6 cMpc of PJ231-20 at the same redshift, indicating an LAE overdensity around this quasar.

The radially-averaged CII and dust continuum emission have similar extensions (up to θ=2.51+0.46−0.25 arcsec, corresponding to r=9.8+3.3−2.1 kpc accounting for beam-convolution), confirming that J1148+5251 is the quasar with the largest CII-emitting has reservoir known at these epochs.Moreover, if the CII emission is examined only along its NE-SW axis, a significant excess (\u003e5.8σ) of CII emission (with respect to the dust) is detected. The new wide--bandwidth observations enable us to accurately constrain the continuum emission, and do not statistically require the presence of broad CII line wings that were reported in previous studies. We also report the first detection of the OI and (tentatively) NII emission lines in J1148+5251. Using Fine Structure Lines (FSL) ratios of the [CII], NII, OI and previously measured CI emission lines, we show that J1148+5251 has similar ISM conditions compared to lower--redshift (ultra)-luminous infrared galaxies.

Candidates were identified by looking for compound spectra, where emission lines at a redshift larger than that of the quasar can be identified in the residuals after a QSO spectral template is subtracted from the observed spectra. The narrow diameter of BOSS fibers (2″) then ensures that the object responsible for the additional emission lines must lie close to the line of sight of the QSO and hence provides a high probability of lensing. Among the 12 candidates identified, nine have definite evidence for the presence of a background ELG identified by at least four higher-redshift nebular emission lines. The remaining three probable candidates present a strong asymmetrical emission line attributed to a background Lyman-α emitter (LAE). The QSO-ELG (QSO-LAE) lens candidates have QSO lens redshifts in the range 0.24 ≲ zQSO ≲ 0.66 (0.75 ≲ zQSO ≲ 1.23 ) and background galaxy redshifts in the range 0.48 ≲ zS, ELG ≲ 0.94 (2.17 ≲ zS, LAE ≲ 4.48).

We have determined the completeness of our search, which allows future studies to compute lensing probabilities of galaxies by QSOs and differentiate between different QSO models.

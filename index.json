The velocity separation between the blue and red peaks of the Lyman-alpha profile ($\\Delta v=101\\_{-19}^{+38} (\\pm 48)\\, \\rm{km s}^{-1}$) suggests an extremely high escape fraction of ionising photons $ 59(51)\\% (2\\sigma)$.

On the basis of the high escape fraction measured, we demonstrate that A370p z1 was solely capable of creating an ionised bubble sufficiently large to account for the blue component of its Lyman-alpha profile. We discuss whether A370p z1 may be representative of a larger population of luminous $z\\simeq7 $ double-peaked Lyman-alpha emitting sources with high escape fractions that self-ionised their surroundings without contributions from associated UV-fainter sources.","tags":["High-z galaxies"],"title":"Double-peaked Lyman-alpha emission at z=6.803: a reionisation-era galaxy self-ionising its local H II bubble","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Romain A.

We fit the main Broad Emission Lines (BELs) in the rest-frame range $1280 \\text{ \\AA} \\leq \\lambda \\leq 3000 \\text{ \\AA}$ (OI,CII,SiIV, CIII], CIV and MgII) with a lightly-supervised spline fitting technique. Redshifts are derived from the peaks of each fitted BEL and used to compute relative velocity shifts. We show that our method gives unbiased velocity shifts and is insensitive to spectral resolution and instrumental parameters. It is found that the average blueshift of the CIV line with respect to several low-ionisation lines in luminosity-matched samples does not significantly evolve over $1.5\\gtrsim z\\gtrsim6$. However, the average blueshift increases significantly by a factor $\\sim 2.5$ at $z\\gtrsim 6$. We propose that this redshift evolution can be explained by CIV winds launched perpendicularly to an accretion disk with increased torus opacity at high-redshift, coupled with a potential orientation-driven selection bias. Our results open new exciting avenues of investigation into young quasars in the reionisation epoch.","tags":["Quasars"],"title":"New Constraints on Quasar Evolution: Broad Line Velocity Shifts over 1.5≲z≲7.5","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.A.

Candidates were identified by looking for compound spectra, where emission lines at a redshift larger than that of the quasar can be identified in the residuals after a QSO spectral template is subtracted from the observed spectra. The narrow diameter of BOSS fibers (2″) then ensures that the object responsible for the additional emission lines must lie close to the line of sight of the QSO and hence provides a high probability of lensing. Among the 12 candidates identified, nine have definite evidence for the presence of a background ELG identified by at least four higher-redshift nebular emission lines. The remaining three probable candidates present a strong asymmetrical emission line attributed to a background Lyman-α emitter (LAE). The QSO-ELG (QSO-LAE) lens candidates have QSO lens redshifts in the range 0.24 ≲ zQSO ≲ 0.66 (0.75 ≲ zQSO ≲ 1.23 ) and background galaxy redshifts in the range 0.48 ≲ zS, ELG ≲ 0.94 (2.17 ≲ zS, LAE ≲ 4.48). We show that the algorithmic search is complete at  90% for QSO-ELG systems, whereas it falls at 40-60% for QSO-LAE, depending on the redshift of the source. Upon confirmation of the lensing nature of the systems, this sample may quadruple the number of known QSOs acting as strong lenses. We have determined the completeness of our search, which allows future studies to compute lensing probabilities of galaxies by QSOs and differentiate between different QSO models. Future imaging of the full sample and lens modelling offers a unique approach to study and constrain key properties of QSOs.

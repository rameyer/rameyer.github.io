Welcome to my website! I am an astronomer and astrophysicist at the Observatory of Geneva, where I study early galaxy evolution. As a multi-wavelength observer, I use the largest telescopes on the ground and in space (VLT, Keck, ALMA, NOEMA, JWST, HST) to understand how the first galaxies formed, how their central supermassive black holes grow, and how the first sources of light reionised the Universe.

I obtained my PhD at University College London in 2020 (you can find my thesis [here](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10112095/)), followed by a first postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, Heidelberg. Since 2023 I have joined the University of Geneva and the observatory as a Research and Teaching Fellow. You can find my full CV [here](/assets/pdf/CV_RAM.pdf) and my list of publications [here](/publications/).

My ongoing projects revolve mostly around cosmic hydrogen reionisation and its sources (VLT/JWST), and the gas reservoirs feeding early supermassive black holes (ALMA/NOEMA). I'm also very interested in machine-learning methods and simulation-based inference techniques which, I believe, are becoming more and more necessary to interpret the rich datasets we are getting from ALMA and JWST.

abstract: "We present a new method to study the contribution of faint sources to the UV background using the 1D correlation of metal absorbers with the intergalactic medium (IGM) transmission in a Quasi Stellar Object (QSO) sightline. We take advantage of a sample of $25$ high signal-to-noise ratio QSO spectra to retrieve $150$ triply-ionised carbon (CIV) absorbers at $4.5\\lesssim z\\lesssim 6.2$, of which $37$ systems whose expected H{~\\small I} absorption lie in the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest. We derive improved constraints on the cosmic density of at $4.3< z < 6.2$ and infer from abundance-matching that CIV absorbers trace $M_{\\text{UV}}\\lesssim -16$ galaxies. 
Correlation with the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest of the QSOs indicates that these objects are surrounded by a highly opaque region at $r\\lesssim 5 $ cMpc/h followed by an excess of transmission at $r\\gtrsim 10$ cMpc/h detected at $2.7\\sigma$. This is in contrast to equivalent measurements at lower redshifts where only the opaque trough is detected.
We interpret this excess as a statistical enhancement of the local photoionisation rate due to clustered faint galaxies around the CIV sabsorbers. Using the analytical framework described in Paper I of this series, we derive a constraint on the average product of the escape fraction and the Lyman continuum photon production efficiency of the galaxy population clustered around the CIV absorbers, $\\log \\langle f\\_{\\text{esc}}\\xi\\_{\\text{ion}}\\rangle /[{\\rm erg^{-1}~Hz}] =  25.01^{+0.30}\\_{-0.19}$. This implies that faint galaxies beyond the reach of current facilities may have harder radiation fields and/or larger escape fractions than currently detected objects at the end of the reionisation epoch."

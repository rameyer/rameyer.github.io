abstract: "We report the discovery of a double-peaked Lyman-alpha profile in a galaxy at $z=6.803$, A370p\_z1, in the parallel Frontier Field of Abell 370. The velocity separation between the blue and red peaks of the Lyman-alpha profile ($\\Delta v=101\\_{-19}^{+38} (\\pm 48)\\, \\rm{km s}^{-1}$) suggests an extremely high escape fraction of ionising photons $> 59(51)\\% (2\\sigma)$. The spectral energy distribution indicates a young ($50$ Myr), star-forming  ($12\\pm 6 \\, \\rm{M}\_\\odot \\rm{yr}^{-1}$) galaxy with an IRAC excess implying strong [OIII]+H$\\beta$ emission. On the basis of the high escape fraction measured, we demonstrate that A370p\_z1 was solely capable of creating an ionised bubble sufficiently large to account for the blue component of its Lyman-alpha profile. We discuss whether A370p\_z1 may be representative of a larger population of luminous $z\\simeq7 $ double-peaked Lyman-alpha emitting sources with high escape fractions that self-ionised their surroundings without contributions from associated UV-fainter sources."

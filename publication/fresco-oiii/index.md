abstract: "We present the census of H$\beta$+\rm{[OIII]}\ $4960,5008\ \text{\AA}$ emitters at $6.8<z<9.0$ from the JWST FRESCO survey over 124 arcmin$^2$ in the GOODS-North and GOODS-South fields. Our unbiased spectroscopic search results in 137 spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at $6.8<z<9.0$ with observed [OIII] fluxes $f_{\rm{ [OIII]}}\gtrsim 1\times 10^{-18}\ \rm{ergs}\ \rm{s}^{-1} \ \rm{cm}^{-2}$. The rest-frame optical line ratios of the median stacked spectrum (median $M_{\rm{UV}}=-19.65^{\tabularrel+0.59}_{\tabularrel-1.05}$) indicate negligible dust attenuation, low metallicity ($12+\log(\rm{O/H})= 7.2-7.7$) and a high ionisation parameter $\log_{10}U \simeq -2.5$. We find a factor $\times 1.3$ difference in the number density of $6.8<z<9.0$ galaxies between GOODS-South and GOODS-North, which is caused by a single overdensity at $7.0<z<7.2$ in GOODS-North. The bright end of the UV luminosity function of spectroscopically-confirmed [OIII] emitters is in good agreement with HST dropout-selected samples. Discrepancies between the observed [OIII] LF, [OIII]/UV ratio and [OIII] equivalent widths, and that predicted by theoretical models, suggest burstier star-formation histories and/or more heterogeneous metallicity and ionising conditions in $z>7$ galaxies. We report a rapid decline of the [OIII] luminosity density  at $z\gtrsim 6-7$ which cannot be explained by the evolution of the cosmic star-formation rate density. Finally we find that FRESCO detects in only $2$h galaxies likely accounting for $\sim 10-20\%$ of the ionising budget at $z=7-8$ (assuming an escape fraction of $10\%$), raising the prospect of directly detecting a significant fraction of the sources of reionisation with JWST."
